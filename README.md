Hi, I'm **Nithin**  Applied Data Science Graduate student at **Syracuse University** who loves turning messy data into intelligent systems that actually matter.

I don't just build models to hit accuracy metrics. I build them to **solve real problems**  whether that's optimizing healthcare operations, analyzing 92 million election records, or building AI agents that orchestrate complex workflows.

When I'm not training models, you'll find me experimenting with new ML tools, creating dashboards that tell stories, or diving deep into the latest in LLMs and MLOps.
